Abstract
Objective:
Health literacy is crucial for a person to make informed health decisions and maintain well-being. Low health literacy is associated with lower health outcomes and higher healthcare expenses.
Evaluating health literacy level among university students is essential for developing countries like Bangladesh, where research on the subject is limited. This study aimed to assess the health literacy status,
and its associated factors among university students in Bangladesh.
Methods:
Data were collected through an online-based cross-sectional survey using the HLS-EU-Q47. Health literacy scores were obtained for each participant. 
Frequency distribution, ANOVA, t-test, and multiple linear regression methods were used to analyze the data.
Results:
A total of 2253 responses were collected from 76 different universities in Bangladesh. The participants had an average age of 21.88 years (S.D. 1.47) with 64.8% of them being male. 
Analysis revealed that 88.68% of the students have limited, whereas 10.30% have sufficient, and only 1.02% have excellent overall health literacy.  More than 80% of the students have limited health literacy 
in all three domains of health literacy. The analysis also revealed that health literacy significantly differs for university type, academic year, hometown area, current residence, parental education level, father's
occupation, family income, and physical exercise. Regression analysis showed that students’ academic year, hometown area, current residence, father’s occupation, and physical exercise level significantly affect
health literacy.
Conclusions: 
University students in Bangladesh exhibit concerning levels of limited health literacy across various domains. Urgent action is needed from universities, policymakers, and government bodies to address this issue.
Keywords: Health literacy, University students, Cross-sectional study, Bangladesh.
